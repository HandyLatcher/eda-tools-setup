Welcome! 🎉
This repository is a personal log of my participation in the **VLSI System Design (VSD) RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program** — India’s largest open-source silicon design initiative.

Through this journey, I’ll document my week-by-week learning, experiments, and milestones as I move from **RTL → GDSII → Tapeout** using open-source EDA tools.

## 🌟 About the Program

🚀 The **SoC Tapeout Program** is a collaborative effort bringing together **3500+ participants across India** to design and tapeout real silicon.

📚 Over the course of the program, we learn how to:

* ✍️ Write RTL for SoC components
* 🔄 Perform synthesis and verification
* 🏗️ Carry out physical design with open-source tools
* 🎯 Deliver a tapeout-ready chip

💡 This initiative empowers engineers, students, and enthusiasts to explore semiconductor design with accessible, open-source methodologies.

## 📅 Week 0 — Foundation: Environment Setup

The first milestone was preparing the environment with essential tools:

* 🧠 **Yosys** → RTL Synthesis
* 📟 **Icarus Verilog** → Simulation
* 📊 **GTKWave** → Waveform Analysis
* ⚡ **Ngspice** → Circuit Simulation
* 🎨 **Magic VLSI** → Layout Design
* 🐳 **Docker** → Containerized flow setup
* 🏗️ **OpenLane** → Complete RTL-to-GDSII flow

✅ With these installed, the environment is ready for deeper design exploration.
