## **1. Introduction** üìñ

In **Week 0** of the **VLSI System Design (VSD) Program**, the focus is on preparing the **development environment** for the upcoming digital VLSI and SoC design tasks.

This includes:

* Installing and configuring **open-source EDA tools** for synthesis, simulation, and layout.
* Setting up a **virtual machine (VM)** to provide a stable workspace.
* Ensuring all tools are tested and verified before starting design experiments.

The program aims to provide hands-on experience in the **RTL ‚Üí GDSII design flow**, using open-source tools to understand the complete VLSI process.

## **2. System Requirements** üíª

To run the required tools smoothly, the following **system configuration** is recommended:

| Component            | Specification    |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Operating System** | Ubuntu 20.04+    |
| **RAM**              | 6 GB             |
| **Storage**          | 50 GB HDD        |
| **vCPU**             | 4                |

Additionally, the tools will be installed and executed inside a **Virtual Machine (VM)** using **Oracle VirtualBox**.

## 3. Tools for Week0 Setup‚öôÔ∏è

This week focuses on installing the essential open-source tools for VLSI design. The tools include **Yosys** for RTL synthesis, **Icarus Verilog** for simulation, **GTKWave** for waveform analysis, **Ngspice** for circuit simulation, and **Magic VLSI** for layout design.

### **1. Yosys ‚Äì RTL Synthesis Tool** üü¶

**Purpose:**
Yosys is an **open-source RTL synthesis tool** used to convert Verilog designs into gate-level netlists. It is essential for **logic synthesis, verification, and preparing designs for further VLSI implementation**.

**Installation Steps:**

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ git clone https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys.git
$ cd yosys
$ sudo apt install make (If make is not installed please install it)
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential clang bison flex \
 libreadline-dev gawk tcl-dev libffi-dev git \
 graphviz xdot pkg-config python3 libboost-system-dev \
 libboost-python-dev libboost-filesystem-dev zlib1g-dev
$ make config-gcc
$ make
$ sudo make install 
```
