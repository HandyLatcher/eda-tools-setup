# 🛠️ Week 0 – Tool Installation & Setup

## **1. Introduction** 📖

In **Week 0** of the **VLSI System Design (VSD) Program**, the focus is on preparing the **development environment** for the upcoming digital VLSI and SoC design tasks.

This includes:

* Installing and configuring **open-source EDA tools** for synthesis, simulation, and layout.
* Setting up a **virtual machine (VM)** to provide a stable workspace.
* Ensuring all tools are tested and verified before starting design experiments.

The program aims to provide hands-on experience in the **RTL → GDSII design flow**, using open-source tools to understand the complete VLSI process.



## **2. System Requirements** 💻

To run the required tools smoothly, the following **system configuration** is recommended:

| Component            | Specification    |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Operating System** | Ubuntu 20.04+ 🐧 |
| **RAM**              | 6 GB 💾          |
| **Storage**          | 50 GB HDD 💿     |
| **vCPU**             | 4 ⚡             |

Additionally, the tools will be installed and executed inside a **Virtual Machine (VM)** using **Oracle VirtualBox**.
